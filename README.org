* doc-org
Cli command that generates a pdf starting from three files:
- main.org :: the first org file that will be compiled. In this file you can
  include other org or latex files.
- header.tex :: the latex header, that contains document class, packages and so
  on.
- config.json :: contains some parameters (at the moment just the title of the
  pdf).

Doc-org uses docker, which means you don't need to have latex or emacs installed
in your machine.

Dor-org is for people who already have a latex template and want to use org-mode
to write the content of their document.
Anyway, org mode supports latex, so you can use latex code when needed.
