* Presentation
Cli command that generates a pdf starting from three files:
- main.org :: the first org file that will be compiled. In this file you can
  include other org or latex files. It contains the contents of the document.
- header.tex :: the latex header, that contains document class, packages and so
  on. It tells how your document should look like (required if ="auto_latex": false=.
- config.json :: contains configuration parameters (optional).

Doc-org uses docker, which means you don't need to have latex or emacs installed
on your machine.

Doc-org is for people who already have a latex template and want to use org-mode
to write the content of their document.
With doc-org you have full control of the latex output.
If you are already happy with the default latex export function of org mode
(i.e. you don't want to specify an header.tex), this is not the project you are
looking for.

* Features
Org mode supports latex, so you can use latex inside an org file when needed.

* configuration

=config.json= file and all of its fields are optional.
This is an example of this file, where all parameters are present:
#+begin_src
{
    "pdf_filename": "my document",
    "auto_latex": false
}
#+end_src

- pdf_filename :: name of the output pdf.
- auto_latex :: org-mode will create necessary latex code automatically.
  =header.tex= file is not used, doc-org does not modify the output of emacs.
  It is false by default.
